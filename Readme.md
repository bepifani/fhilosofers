# Philosophers
Eat, Sleep, Spaghetti, repeat. This project is about learning how threads work by precisely timing a group of philosophers on when to pick up forks and eat spaghetti without dying from hunger. 
## Start:
1) multi-threads and use of mutex
~~~
make
./philo time_die time_eat time_sleep
~~~
2) multi-processes and use of semaphore
~~~
make
./philo_bonus time_die time_eat time_sleep
